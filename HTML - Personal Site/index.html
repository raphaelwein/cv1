        <h1>Raphael Wein</h1>
        <p><em>Business Development and Sales Manager</em></p>
        <p>Working with a team to achieve goals and objectives is a passion. I have worked in executive and director roles as well as managing teams in the non-profit and private sectors.
          Different industries have provided me with various tools such as leadership and responsibility, verbal and written communication, teamwork and management and most importantly problem solving.
          In my current role I focus on creating long-term value from customers, markets, and relationships with existing accounts and campaigns. </p>
